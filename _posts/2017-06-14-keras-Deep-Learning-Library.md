# Keras #
## Deep Learning library for Python. Runs on TensorFlow, Theano or CNTK. ##

- Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
